# EasyExam

## The problem
For kids who don’t speak and have problems with motoric skills, it is very hard to go through the traditional schooling systems. One of the challenges comes from the fact the teachers have no knowledge how to do the school exercises and examination. An other challenge is that some kids are able to write down an answer using a computer keyboard or tablet, but some of them are only able to point out the right answer.

## An experimental project
Let’s create a Quiz-like UI where the kids can choose the right answer from predefined questions maintained by the teachers.
